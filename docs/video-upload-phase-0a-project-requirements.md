# Video Upload Project Type - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for adding a new project type system to the application, introducing **Video Upload** projects alongside the existing **Voice Recording** projects. This enhancement will allow users to create content by uploading videos instead of recording audio, with automatic video transcription and content generation.

## Project Architecture

### Current State
- Single project type: Audio recording at `/new`
- Audio processing → transcript → content generation workflow
- N8N webhooks for audio processing and content creation

### Target State
- Two project types: **Voice Recording** and **Video Upload**
- Unified content generation workflow for both types
- Project type differentiation throughout the application
- Enhanced navigation with dropdown menu system

## Core Requirements

### 1. Project Type System

#### Database Schema Changes
- Add `project_type` field to `content` table
- Values: `"voice_recording"` and `"video_upload"`
- Default to `"voice_recording"` for backward compatibility

#### Project Type Display
- Show project type in content tables (drafts, scheduled, etc.)
- Display project type on content details page
- Hide transcript section for video upload projects

### 2. Navigation & User Experience

#### Enhanced "New Content" System
- Convert "New Content" buttons to buttons with dropdown menus
- Button appearance: "New Content" text with down arrow icon on the right
- Click behavior: Opens menu with two options: "Voice Recording" and "Video Upload"
- Locations to update:
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Drafts page header
  - Any other "New Content" buttons throughout the app

#### URL Structure Changes
- **Current**: `/new` (audio recording)
- **New Structure**:
  - `/voice-recording` (replaces `/new`)
  - `/video-upload` (new page)

### 3. Voice Recording Project (Existing → Enhanced)

#### Page: `/voice-recording`
- **Components**: Reuse existing `AudioRecorder` component
- **Workflow**: Existing audio processing workflow
- **Project Type**: Set to `"voice_recording"`
- **Changes**: Minimal - just URL change and project type assignment

### 4. Video Upload Project (New)

#### Page: `/video-upload`
- **Components**: Reuse `VideoUploadModal` and `VideoUploadSection` components
- **File Storage**: Videos bucket with pattern `{businessId}_{contentId}_video_upload.{extension}`
- **Project Type**: Set to `"video_upload"`
- **Video Field**: Store URL in `content.video_long_url`

#### Video Upload Workflow
1. User uploads video → stored in Supabase videos bucket
2. Create content record with `project_type: "video_upload"`
3. Trigger video transcription via `N8N_WEBHOOK_VIDEO_TRANSCRIPTION`
4. N8N callback updates content with transcript and video script
5. Auto-trigger content creation workflow (`N8N_WEBHOOK_URL_CONTENT_CREATION`)
6. Navigate to drafts page

#### N8N Integration
- **Webhook**: `N8N_WEBHOOK_VIDEO_TRANSCRIPTION`
- **Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "video_url": "https://supabase-url/storage/v1/object/public/videos/file.mp4",
    "content_id": "uuid",
    "business_id": "uuid",
    "project_type": "video_upload",
    "callbackUrl": "https://app-url/api/n8n/callback",
    "callbackSecret": "secret",
    "environment": "development"
  }
  ```

- **Expected Callback**:
  ```json
  {
    "content_id": "uuid",
    "transcript": "transcribed text...",
    "video_script": "generated script...",
    "content_title": "AI-generated title"
  }
  ```

### 5. Content Display Enhancements

#### Content Tables (Drafts, Scheduled, etc.)
- Add "Project Type" column
- Display: "Voice Recording" or "Video Upload"
- Maintain existing functionality

#### Content Details Page
- Display project type under headline
- **For Voice Recording**: Show all existing sections
- **For Video Upload**: Hide transcript section completely
- Maintain all other functionality

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database & Core Infrastructure

#### Database Migration
- [x] Create migration file: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add-project-type-to-content.sql`

- **Content Type Confusion**: Clear project type indicators throughout

### Business Risks
- **Workflow Disruption**: Maintain all existing functionality during transition
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure proper project type assignment for all content
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor system performance with new features

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Database + Navigation)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days (Video Upload Implementation)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (Content Display Updates)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days (Testing & Polish)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 days (Documentation & Deployment)

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-15 days

## Notes
