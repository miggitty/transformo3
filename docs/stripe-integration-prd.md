## **üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture**

### **Data Model**
- **Business-centric billing**: One Stripe customer per business (not per user)
- **Subscription tracking**: Full lifecycle management via webhooks
- **Audit trail**: Complete event logging for compliance and debugging

### **Access Control Strategy**
```
Trial (7 days) ‚Üí Active Subscription ‚Üí Past Due (7-day grace) ‚Üí Access Denied
                ‚Üì
            Canceled (access until period end) ‚Üí Access Denied
```

### **Infrastructure Requirements**
- **Environment**: Next.js 15 App Router with Supabase backend
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with RLS policies
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout with Customer Portal
- **Real-time**: Webhook-driven subscription status updates

---

## **üí∞ Business Model**

### **Pricing Structure**
- **Free Trial**: 7 days, full feature access
- **Monthly Plan**: $29/month
- **Yearly Plan**: $290/year (2 months free)
- **Grace Period**: 7 days for failed payments

### **Feature Access Levels**
```typescript
type AccessLevel = 'full' | 'trial' | 'grace' | 'denied';

// Trial: Full access with usage limitations and trial banners
// Full: Complete access to all features
// Grace: Continued access with payment failure warnings
// Denied: No access, redirect to billing page
```
