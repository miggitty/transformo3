# Video Upload Implementation - Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the video uploading functionality according to the PRD specifications in `/docs/video-uploading.md`. The feature is now live and functional.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Components Created

- **`components/shared/video-upload-section.tsx`** - Main section component with two-column layout for long and short videos
- **`components/shared/video-upload-modal.tsx`** - Modal with drag & drop, file validation, and progress tracking
- **`components/shared/video-player.tsx`** - Simple HTML5 video player component
- **`components/shared/delete-video-dialog.tsx`** - Confirmation dialog for video deletion

### 2. Backend Integration

- **Server Action**: Added `updateVideoUrl()` in `/app/(app)/content/[id]/actions.ts` for secure video URL updates
- **Database**: Uses existing `video_long_url` and `video_short_url` fields in content table
- **Storage**: Integrates with existing Supabase `videos` bucket with proper RLS policies

### 3. Key Features Implemented

✅ **Two Video Types**: Separate upload areas for long and short social media videos
✅ **File Validation**: 
- Supported formats: MP4 (recommended), WebM, MOV
- Max file size: 400MB
- Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages

✅ **Upload Experience**:
- Drag & drop interface
- File browser fallback
- Progress tracking (simulated for better UX)
- Upload prevention during concurrent operations

✅ **Video Management**:
- Click-to-play video player (no autoplay, no thumbnail)
- Replace existing videos
- Delete videos with confirmation dialog

✅ **Security & Error Handling**:
- Server-side validation using Zod schemas
- RLS policy enforcement
- Comprehensive error handling with retry suggestions
- Proper file cleanup on deletion

### 4. UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Two-column layout on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Loading States**: Progress bars, spinners, and disabled states during operations
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback for all operations
- **Consistent Styling**: Uses ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS

## File Structure

```
components/shared/
├── video-upload-section.tsx       # Main container component
├── video-upload-modal.tsx         # Upload modal with drag & drop
├── video-player.tsx               # Video playback component
└── delete-video-dialog.tsx        # Delete confirmation dialog

app/(app)/content/[id]/
└── actions.ts                     # Added updateVideoUrl server action

components/shared/
└── content-detail-client-page.tsx # Integrated video section
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Content Details Page
- Added video upload section above ContentAssetsManager
- Section titled "Social Media Videos"
- Only visible when user has permissions (respects existing RLS)

### 2. State Management
- Local content state management for real-time UI updates
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Server action integration for data persistence

### 3. Storage Integration
- Files stored as: `{contentId}_long_video.{ext}` or `{contentId}_short_video.{ext}`
- Automatic file replacement (upsert behavior)
- Public URL generation for video playback

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to Content Details**:
   - Go to `/content` and click on any content item
   - Scroll to the "Social Media Videos" section (above content assets)

2. **Test Upload Flow**:
   - Click "Upload Long Video" or "Upload Short Video"
   - Drag & drop a video file or use "Browse Files"
   - Verify file validation (try invalid format/size)
   - Watch progress indicator during upload
   - Confirm video appears and is playable

3. **Test Video Management**:
   - Click on uploaded video to play
   - Use "Upload New Video" to replace existing
   - Use delete button (trash icon) and confirm deletion
   - Verify video is removed from both UI and storage

4. **Test Error Scenarios**:
   - Try uploading file > 400MB
   - Try uploading non-video file
   - Test network interruption during upload

### Browser Testing
- ✅ Chrome/Safari (desktop)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (responsive design)
- ✅ File drag & drop support

## Performance Notes

- Large video files (up to 400MB) upload directly to Supabase Storage
- No server-side processing keeps uploads fast
- Simulated progress tracking provides good UX during upload
- Lazy loading of video content

## Security Implementation

- Server actions validate all inputs using Zod schemas
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access to videos
- File validation prevents malicious uploads
- Proper cleanup of storage files on deletion

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Real upload progress tracking (requires custom upload implementation)
- Video compression/optimization
- Thumbnail generation
- Video preview before upload
- Batch upload capabilities
- Cloud video processing integration
